# A simple script to set up or stop a SSH tunnel
# to another remote server
#
# Usage:
#
#   profixy start server
#   # => Sets up the tunnel and saves the PID in /tmp/proxify.pid
#
#   profixy stop
#   # => Reads the process id from /tmp/proxify.pid and kills that process.
#

PORT=8080                # The local port to be used for forwarding. Change if desired.
