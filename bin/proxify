#!/bin/bash
#
# A simple script to set up or stop a SSH tunnel
# to another remote server
#
# You can then setup a proxy in your favorite browser, like
# Firefox with this extension: FoxyProxy Basic
# You want to use:
# - server: localhost
# - port: 8080
# - connection type: Socks version 5
#
# Usage:
#
#   profixy start server
#   # => Sets up the tunnel and saves the PID in /tmp/proxify.pid
#
#   profixy stop
#   # => Reads the process id from /tmp/proxify.pid and kills that process.
#

PORT=8080                # The local port to be used for forwarding. Change if desired.

if [ $# -lt 2 ]
  REMOTE=$2
then
  REMOTE=netflix           # Your server. Mine is aliased in ~/.ssh/config as netflix.
                           # this would typically be something like user@server or similar.
fi

PIDFILE=/tmp/proxify.pid # will just hold the numeric process id of the tunnel
