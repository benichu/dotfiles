# Ben's dotfiles

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/benichu/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && ./bootstrap.sh
```

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to set some sensible OS X defaults:

```bash
./.osx
```

To update, `cd` into your local `dotfiles` repository and then:

```bash
./bootstrap.sh
```
